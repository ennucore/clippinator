The patch format is a text-based representation designed to apply modifications to another text, typically source code. 
Each modification is represented by a line range to be replaced, followed by the replacement content. 
The line range is specified in brackets, such as [start-end] to replace from start to end (10-20 will erase lines 10, 11, ..., 19, 1-indexed, and replace them by the new content) or [line] to insert a line after the specified line, where the line numbers are 1-indexed. 
The replacement content follows the line range and can span multiple lines. Here is a sample patch:
```
[2-3]
replacement for lines 2 and 3
[5]
insert after line 5 (btw, use [5-5] with nothing after it if you want to delete the fifth line)
[20-20]
replacement for line 20
```
The patch lines are applied in order, and the ranges must not overlap or intersect. Any violation of this format will result in an error.
Make sure to read the relevant part of the file before patching, especially if you're trying to fix something.
