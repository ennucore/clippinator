<advice>Use rewrite_file instead of patches if the file is less than 2000 lines</advice>
<advice>When rewriting a file, make sure you know its full content and you write the correct and complete content - you cannot skip anything</advice>
<advice>Usually, you should first make a plan, then use the function calls to implement it. After that, check that everything has been done correctly: read files, etc. After that you can write <DONE/></advice>
<advice>After making some changes to the codebase, run the linter to check for any issues</advice>
<advice>Usualy, the plan should look kind of like this:
1. Read the relevant files if they are not provided
2. Write your thoughts on how to perform the necessary changes
3. Rewrite the files with your changes
4. Run the linter, sometimes run the tests too
5. If everything is fine, write <DONE/></advice>
<advice>If you can't read some file, use ls or tree to see what's in that directory and which file you should read</advice>
